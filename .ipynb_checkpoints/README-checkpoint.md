## Overview

siRNADiscovery leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the efficacy of small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences in gene silencing. This model incorporates RNA-protein interaction probabilities and siRNA-mRNA base-pairing probabilities as part of its predictive framework.

## Data Preprocessing

### RNA-Protein Interaction Probabilities

To generate RNA-protein interaction probabilities, we utilize tools provided by the [RPISeq website](http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/RPISeq/). These probabilities are essential for building RNA-protein interaction features used in siRNADiscovery.

### siRNA-mRNA Base-Pairing Probabilities

For siRNA-mRNA base-pairing probabilities, we use the [ViennaRNA package](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/). Specifically, tools like **RNAcofold** and **RNAfold** are employed for calculating these pairing probabilities.

Refer to the **Data_preprocess** folder for detailed instructions on executing RNAcofold and RNAfold.


## Dependencies

Ensure that you have the following installed to run the code smoothly:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (list of dependencies in `requirements.txt`)
- ViennaRNA (for siRNA-mRNA base-pairing calculations)

To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

You can reproduce the results by executing the relevant scripts located in the `siRNA_split` and `mRNA_split` folders.

To run the model, use the following command:

```bash
python siRNADiscovery.py
```
